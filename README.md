# Manual testing of web authentication using TestRail and Jira (Scrum workflow)

## Project Overview

This simple project demonstrates a structured manual QA workflow applied to a web authentication feature and highlights the role of a test scenario within the SDLC.

Scope of testing:

- Login / Logout functionality
- Cross-browser validation
- Negative scenario validation
- Session behavior verification


## Testing Framework & Environment

### Tools
- TestRail (test case design and execution management)
- Jira (Scrum-based sprint tracking and defect management)
- Google Chrome (cross-browser testing)
- Mozilla Firefox (cross-browser testing)
- Windows OS

### Methodology & Approach
- Agile (Scrum framework)
- Manual test execution
- Functional testing
- Black-box testing approach
- Positive and negative test design

## Test Case Design (TestRail)

- Unique test IDs
- Defined preconditions
- Step-by-step execution steps
- Clear expected results
- Positive and negative scenarios

A total of 10 authentication-related test cases were created.

## Test Execution (Cross-Browser Validation)

Test cases were executed within separate test runs to validate authentication behavior across different browsers.

Execution was performed manually in:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

This ensured consistent functionality and behavior across environments.

## Test Result Documentation

Test results were recorded directly within TestRail, including:

- Pass / Fail status
- Actual results
- Observations
- Environment-specific notes

This demonstrates structured defect documentation and clear traceability of execution outcomes.

#### Failed Test Example:
